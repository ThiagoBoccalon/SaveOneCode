# How do I learn to code? What are my first steps?

Many people think which to became a developer is essential to be excellent in maths and numbers. In fact, wheter you are a excellent in Math probabily it could help to learn  quicklier but it is not sure.
However, more important than you get aptitude in Math is you deep learn fundamentals and practise constantely.


Therefore, let's go to learn ðŸš€ðŸ’»!


### Algorithms - What's an Algorithm?

Algorithms can be deine as a set of rules or instructions to solve a problem or perform a task. 

However, algorithms help us to break down complex problem into smaller and simpler steps where it will have inputs, process and output.

They are used in many fields and situations, such as mathematics, computer science, games, medicine, and etc.



### Why Algorithms are important?

Algorithms help us to organize ad structure our thinking and actions in a logical and efficient way. Besides, they help us to undarstand the processes and solutions of others.

[Let's see this video - Steve Jobs, Mark and Bill talk about importance of algorithms in our life]


### Creating algorithm - How can I do it?

First o all, we do not necessarily need a laptop or PC.  An algorithm can be simple like a recipe to bake a cake, or it could be more complex for solving a complicated problem. In this case, we can say that algorithms can be writeen on papper, impremented in a computer, or even explained verbally.

### History o Algorithms
The concept of algorithms has a long history. The word "algorithm" can be traced back back to 9th century.

In the moder era, the development of computer algorithms has been rapid. ro instance, in 1936, the Turing machine, an abstract machine that developed the modern notion of "algorithm", was introduced.

## Creating Algorithms

To create an algorithm involves identifying the input, and output, and goal of the problem or task. However, we need to include precise, step-by-step instructions. And then, finally we'll need testing and debugging the algorithm  to make sure it works correctly.
